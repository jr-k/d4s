## 🚀 Installation

### Homebrew (MacOS / Linux)
```bash
brew install jr-k/d4s/d4s
```
---
### Docker
```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ghcr.io/jr-k/d4s:latest
```

**You might want to create an alias for quicker usage. For example:**

```bash
echo "alias d4s='docker run --rm --pull always -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ghcr.io/jr-k/d4s:latest'" >> ~/.zshrc
```
*After running this, either restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bashrc` for Bash) to enable the alias.*

### Binary Releases (Linux / MacOS / Windows)


> Automated
```bash
curl -fsSL https://d4scli.io/install.sh | sh

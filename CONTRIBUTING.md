3. If you update or add features, **update the documentation** as well.
4. Write code that follows the official [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines.
5. **Test your changes** locally.

## 📦 Dependency Management

We use Go modules for dependency management. If you need to update or add dependencies for your PR:

1. Make your code changes as needed.
2. To update or add a dependency, run:
   ```sh
   go get -u github.com/username/modulename
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

If you have questions or issues with dependency management, feel free to reach out in your pull request or open an issue.

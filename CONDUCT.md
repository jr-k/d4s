# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We aim to foster a friendly, respectful, and productive environment. We expect all contributors and maintainers to help ensure a collaborative space where everyone feels welcome to participate, contribute, and learn, regardless of background or personal characteristics.

## Expected Behavior

Positive engagement is expected from all participants and includes:

* Using courteous and constructive language
* Being respectful of differing perspectives and experiences
* Accepting constructive feedback gracefully
* Focusing discussion and efforts on improving the project
* Supporting and encouraging fellow contributors

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
* Harassment, threats, or intimidation
* Disruptive or intentionally offensive comments or behavior
* Publishing others’ private information without permission
* Conduct that would generally be considered inappropriate or unprofessional in a collaborative setting

## Maintainers’ Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

* Clearly communicating and upholding these standards
* Addressing reports of unacceptable behavior fairly and promptly
* Removing, editing, or rejecting comments, code, or other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct
* Banning any contributor, temporarily or permanently, for inappropriate, threatening, or offensive behavior

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all official project channels—this includes the repository, issues, pull requests, and any other spaces where the project’s community interacts. It also applies to public events or forums where community members are representing the project.

## Reporting & Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by contacting the [project maintainer](https://github.com/jesseduffield). All reports will be handled confidentially and with respect for all parties involved. Project maintainers are obligated to address any violations as deemed appropriate for the circumstances.

Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent restrictions from participation, as decided by the project leadership team.

## Attribution

Parts of this Code of Conduct are inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), adapted for clarity and focus on respect and professionalism.
